# **Game of War**
---
### Project information
<dd> A simple version of the classic card game War created using primarily Javascript. Each player is dealt half a deck of cards.  They both show the card at the top of their deck, and whoever has a card of higher face value wins the round and puts both cards at the bottom of their deck. If the players tie, War is declared.  Each player deals three of their cards face down and shows the next card.  Whoever wins this round wins all of the cards. In case of another tie, the process repeats.  The winner of the game is the player who ends up with all the cards in their deck. </dd>
### Technologies Used
<dd> HTML, CSS, Javascript</dd>
### Approach Taken
<dd> I split the game into three primary tasks.  First, I built out a deck of cards and created a function to shuffle them.  Next, I implemented the game logic and created a function to check for the winner of each round and of the game.  Last, I included the logic for War in case there is a tie during a round. </dd>
